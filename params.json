It can take almost any software and offer it as a service to end-users. \r\n\r\n> hurtle enables service and infrastructure orchestration to easily compose, deploy, provision and manage distributed systems\r\n\r\nIts functionality all revolves around this idea, so the service offered is also one that can be designed with the cloud in mind, based on the [cloud-native application research of the ICCLab](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/research-approach/themes/cloud-native-applications/).\r\n\r\n## Where From?\r\n\r\nhurtle has two origins:\r\n\r\n1. is the ICCLab's [Cloud Orchestration Initiative](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/research-approach/themes/cloud-orchestration/)\r\n2. is in the telcom world and in particular [Network Function Virtualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_functions_virtualization). Here hurtle has been used to offer services that have been to date executed directly on or embedded in hardware.\r\n\r\nAnd well, it's all powered upon another hurtle ;-)\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nThis repository provides documentation for hurtle and\r\npointers to the other repositories that make up a complete hurtle system.\r\nSee the [repository list](./docs/repos.md).\r\n\r\nhurtle consists of the following components:\r\n\r\n- [Service Manager](./docs/architecture.md)\r\n- [Service Orchestrator](./docs/architecture.md)\r\n- [CloudController](./docs/architecture.md)\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\n\r\n- [hurtle's Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for overall architecture.\r\n- [hurtle Reference](./docs/reference.md) for an overview of each component.\r\n- The [herp derp](./docs/herpderp.md) for herp derp\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n - Complete orchestration of your software\r\n   - Resources it uses (e.g. virtual machines, networks)\r\n   - External services it needs\r\n - Multi-dc/multi-region support\r\n   - including inter-DC connectivity\r\n - Easy implementation of your service API\r\n - Guided implementation of your service instance manager\r\n   - Many languages supported including Python, Java, Perl, PHP\r\n   - Demo applications available\r\n - Scalable runtime management\r\n - Complete end-to-end logging of your software\r\n - Integration with [OpenStack](), [ICCLab's Joyent SDC contribs]()\r\n - Handle potential incidents of your software\r\n   - Integration with [ICCLab's Watchtower (Cloud Incident Management)](https://github.com/icclab/watchtower-common)\r\n - Bill for your software and services\r\n   - Integration with [ICCLab's Cyclops (Rating, charging & Billing)](https://icclab.github.io/cyclops/)\r\n - Leverages Open Cloud Standards ([OCCI](http://www.occi-wg.org), [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org))\r\n\r\n# How Does hurtle Work?\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to understand how hurtle works is through how its life cycle of an application is managed. There are 6 key phases to understand:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fojvhf728swsfqk/hurtle-lifecycle.png?dl=1\" alt=\"hurtle Text\" title=\"hurtle\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n 1. **Design**: where the topology and dependencies of each component is specified. The model here typically takes the form of a graph.\r\n 2. **Implementation**: ***TODO***\r\n 3. **Deploy**: the complete fleet of resources and services are deployed according to a plan. At this stage they are not configured.\r\n 4. **Provision**: each resource and service is correctly provisioned and configured. This must be done such that one service or resource is not without a required operational dependency (e.g. a php application without its database).\r\n 5. **Runtime**: once all components of an orchestration are running the next key element is that they are managed. To manage means at the most basic level to monitor the components. Based on metrics extracted, performance indicators can be formulated using logic-based rules. These when notified where an indicatorâ€™s threshold is breached, an Orchestrator could take a remedial action ensuring reliability.\r\n 6. **Disposal**: Where a service is deployed through cloud services (e.g. infrastructure; VMs) it may be required to destroy the complete orchestration to redeploy a new version or indeed part of the orchestration destroyed.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Developer setup with devstack\r\n\r\nOr the quick and fast way...\r\n\r\n1. ```curl https://get.hurtle.it | bash```\r\n2. ???\r\n3.

This is followed by a generic sentence why and for what it uses it.\r\n\r\n# Design Principles\r\n\r\nThe principles that guide hurtle are the key basis of [service oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).\r\n\r\n * **Autonomous**: The logic governed by a service resides within an explicit boundary. The service has control within this boundary, and is not tightly coupled to execute.\r\n * **Share a formal contract**: In order for services to interact, they need not share anything but a collection of published metadata that describes each service and defines the terms of information exchange.\r\n * **Loosely coupled**: Dependencies between the underlying logic of a service and its consumers are limited to conformance of the service contract. Services abstract underlying logic, which is invisible to the outside world, beyond what is expressed in the service contract metadata.\r\n * **Composable**: Services may compose others, allowing logic to be represented at different levels of granularity. This allows for reusability and the creation of service abstraction layers and/or platforms.\r\n * Reusable: Whether immediate reuse opportunities exist, services are designed to support potential reuse.\r\n * **Stateless**: Services should be designed to maximise statelessness even if that means deferring state management elsewhere.\r\n * **Discoverable**: Services should allow their descriptions to be discovered and understood by (possibly) humans and service requestors that may be able to make use of their logic.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nhurtle is licensed under the\r\n[Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\nSee the file LICENSE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
