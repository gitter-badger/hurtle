# hurtle?


Q: Why is it Called hurtle?

> A: Cos we like [turtles and recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)

Q: What is your motto?

> A: "Confusing name, simple orchestration"


# Why hurtle?

hurtle lets you:

> offer your software as a service i.e. "hurtle it!"

This is the key aim of hurtle. It can take almost any software and offer it as a service to end-users. 

> hurtle enables service and infrastructure orchestration to easily compose, deploy, provision and manage distributed systems

Its functionality all revolves around this idea, so the service offered is also one that can be designed with the cloud in mind, based on the [cloud-native application research of the ICCLab](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/research-approach/themes/cloud-native-applications/).

## Where From?

hurtle has two origins:

1. is the ICCLab's [Cloud Orchestration Initiative](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/research-approach/themes/cloud-orchestration/)
2. is in the telcom world and in particular [Network Function Virtualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_functions_virtualization) (NFV). Here hurtle has been used to offer services that have been to date executed directly on or embedded in hardware.

And well, it's all powered upon another hurtle ;-)

# Overview

This repository provides documentation for hurtle and
pointers to the other repositories that make up a complete hurtle system.
See the [repository list](./docs/reference.md).

hurtle consists of the following components:

- [Service Manager](./docs/architecture.md)
- [Service Orchestrator](./docs/architecture.md)
- [CloudController](./docs/architecture.md)

For more details, see:

- [hurtle's Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for overall logical architecture.
- [hurtle's Technical Architecture](./docs/hurtle_technical_implementation.md) for details on the implementation of the support components.
- [hurtle's How to write your Hurtle Service?](./docs/how_to_write_a_hurtle_service.md) for details on the components necessary to create a hurtle manageable service. Note that a lot of information can also be found directly in the examples provided here!
- [hurtle Reference & Repolist](./docs/reference.md) for an overview of each component.

# How Does hurtle Work?

The easiest way to understand how hurtle works is through how its life cycle of an application is managed. There are 6 key phases to understand:

<div align="center">
<img src="./docs/figs/hurtle_lifecycle_2.png" alt="hurtle Text" title="hurtle">
</div>

 1. **Design**: where the topology and dependencies of each component is specified. The model here typically takes the form of a graph.
 2. **Implementation**: This is where the developer(s) needs to implement the actual software that will be provided as a service through hurtle
 3. **Deploy**: the complete fleet of resources and services are deployed according to a plan. At this stage they are not configured.
 4. **Provision**: each resource and service is correctly provisioned and configured. This must be done such that one service or resource is not without a required operational dependency (e.g. a php application without its database).
 5. **Runtime**: once all components of an orchestration are running the next key element is that they are managed. To manage means at the most basic level to monitor the components. Based on metrics extracted, performance indicators can be formulated using logic-based rules. These when notified where an indicatorâ€™s threshold is breached, an Orchestrator could take a remedial action ensuring reliability.
 6. **Disposal**: Where a service is deployed through cloud services (e.g. infrastructure; VMs) it may be required to destroy the complete orchestration to redeploy a new version or indeed part of the orchestration destroyed.

# Getting Started

## Quickstart
Note: The Vagrant boxes are quiet demanding (6GB and 2GB of RAM) on your System.

The Vagrant boxes give you a complete environment to play around: OpenStack, OpenShift and the hurtle-sample-so are preinstalled.


```
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/icclab/hurtle.git

# Spin up the Vagrant boxes
cd vagrant 
vagrant up

# Grab a coffee, this could take a while (~3GB download)

# Once the machines are booted up, check out the hurtle-sample-so README file

```

# Roadmap

Hurtling along soon:

 - More examples including the [ cloud native Zurmo implementation from ICCLab](https://github.com/icclab/cna-seed-project)
 - Enhanced workload placement, dynamic policy-based
 - Support for docker-registry deployed containers
 - Runtime updates to service and resource topologies
 - CI and CD support
   - safe monitored dynamic service updates
 - TOSCA support
 - Support for VMware and CloudStack
 - User interface to visualise resource and services relationships
 - Additional external service endpoint protocol support

# Dependencies and Related Projects

Hurtle uses [Generic Software](http://generic-software-url.com) for XZY. This is followed by a generic sentence why and for what it uses it.

# Design Principles

The principles that guide hurtle are the key basis of [service oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).

 * **Autonomous**: The logic governed by a service resides within an explicit boundary. The service has control within this boundary, and is not tightly coupled to execute.
 * **Share a formal contract**: In order for services to interact, they need not share anything but a collection of published metadata that describes each service and defines the terms of information exchange.
 * **Loosely coupled**: Dependencies between the underlying logic of a service and its consumers are limited to conformance of the service contract. Services abstract underlying logic, which is invisible to the outside world, beyond what is expressed in the service contract metadata.
 * **Composable**: Services may compose others, allowing logic to be represented at different levels of granularity. This allows for reusability and the creation of service abstraction layers and/or platforms.
 * Reusable: Whether immediate reuse opportunities exist, services are designed to support potential reuse.
 * **Stateless**: Services should be designed to maximise statelessness even if that means deferring state management elsewhere.
 * **Discoverable**: Services should allow their descriptions to be discovered and understood by (possibly) humans and service requestors that may be able to make use of their logic.
