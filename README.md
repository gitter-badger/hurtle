# Hurtle?
```
Q: Why is it called Hurtle?
A: Cos we like turtles

Q: What is your motto?
A: "Confusing name, simple orchestration"
```

# Why Hurtle?

hurtle lets you:

> offer your software as a service i.e. hurtle-it

This is the key aim of hurtle. Hurtle can take almost any software and offer it as a service to end-users. Its functionality all revolves around this idea, so the service offered is also one that can be designed with the cloud in mind, based on the [cloud-native application research of the ICCLab]().

## Where from?
Hurtle's origin is in the telcom world and in particular Network Function Virtualisation. Here hurtle has been used to offer services that have been to date ran directly on or embedded in hardware.

# Overview

Hurtle  is an open-source cloud service orchestrator. Hurtle is proven: it is the software that orchestrates the [Mobile Cloud Networking Project](http://www.mobile-cloud-networking.eu/site/).

This repository provides documentation for the overall Hurtle project and
pointers to the other repositories that make up a complete Hurtle deployment.
See the [repository list](./docs/developer-guide/repos.md).

Report bugs and request features using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/icclab/hurtle/issues). For additional resources, you can contact the maintainers directly.

Hurtle consists of the following components:

- component 1
- component 2
- component 3

For more details, see:

- [Hurtle Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for
  overall architecture.
- [Hurtle Reference](./docs/reference.md) for an
  overview of each component.

# How does hurtle work?

The easiest way to understand how hurtle works is through how its life cycle of an application is managed. There are 6 key phases to understand:

</div>

 1. **Design**: where the topology and dependencies of each component is specified. The model here typically takes the form of a graph.
 2. **Implementation**: ***TODO***
 3. **Deploy**: the complete fleet of resources and services are deployed according to a plan. At this stage they are not configured.
 4. **Provision**: each resource and service is correctly provisioned and configured. This must be done such that one service or resource is not without a required operational dependency (e.g. a php application without its database).
 5. **Runtime**: once all components of an orchestration are running the next key element is that they are managed. To manage means at the most basic level to monitor the components. Based on metrics extracted, performance indicators can be formulated using logic-based rules. These when notified where an indicatorâ€™s threshold is breached, an Orchestrator could take a remedial action ensuring reliability.
 6. **Disposal**: Where a service is deployed through cloud services (e.g. infrastructure; VMs) it may be required to destroy the complete orchestration to redeploy a new version or indeed part of the orchestration destroyed.

## Dependencies and Related Projects

Hurtle uses [Generic Software](http://generic-software-url.com) for XZY. This is followed by a generic sentence why and for what it uses it.

# Design Principles

The principles that guide hurtle are the key basis of [service oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).

 * **Autonomous**: The logic governed by a service resides within an explicit boundary. The service has control within this boundary, and is not tightly coupled to execute.
 * **Share a formal contract**: In order for services to interact, they need not share anything but a collection of published metadata that describes each service and defines the terms of information exchange.
 * **Loosely coupled**: Dependencies between the underlying logic of a service and its consumers are limited to conformance of the service contract. Services abstract underlying logic, which is invisible to the outside world, beyond what is expressed in the service contract metadata.
 * **Composable**: Services may compose others, allowing logic to be represented at different levels of granularity. This allows for reusability and the creation of service abstraction layers and/or platforms.
 * Reusable: Whether immediate reuse opportunities exist, services are designed to support potential reuse.
 * **Stateless**: Services should be designed to maximise statelessness even if that means deferring state management elsewhere.
 * **Discoverable**: Services should allow their descriptions to be discovered and understood by (possibly) humans and service requestors that may be able to make use of their logic.
